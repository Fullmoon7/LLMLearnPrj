# LLM Learning: BPE Implementations

This repository contains my implementations of the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm as part of my learning journey with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Contents

* **`Tokenization/`**: This directory contains the BPE implementation files.
    * **`data/`**: Contains sample training and testing data.
        * `test.txt`: Sample testing data for `tokenize.py`.
        * `test_BPE.txt`: Sample testing data for `BPE.py`.
        * `train.txt`: Sample training data for `tokenize.py`.
        * `train_BPE.txt`: Sample training data for `BPE.py`.
    * `BPE.py`: A custom, from-scratch implementation of the BPE algorithm.
    * `tokenize.py`: BPE implementation leveraging the `tokenizers` library from Hugging Face.

This repository serves as a record of my progress and understanding of BPE. Expect updates and additions as I continue to learn.
